{{< definition >}}
**Moments:** <br>
They are statistical measures that describe the characteristics of a probability distribution, 
such as its central tendency, spread/variability, and asymmetry. <br>
_Note_: We will discuss '_raw_' and '_central_' moments. <br><br>
_Important moments:_ <br>
1. **Mean** : Central tendency 
2. **Variance** : Spread/variability 
3. **Skewness** : Asymmetry 
4. **Kurtosis** : Tailedness
