What is the meaning of “Regression” in Linear Regression ?
{{</ question >}}

{{< answer >}}
**Regression = Going Back** <br>

*Regression* has a very specific *historical origin* that is different from its current statistical meaning.

**Sir Francis Galton** (19th century), cousin of *Charles Darwin*, coined 🪙 this term.

**Observation:** <br>
Galton observed that - <br>
the children 👶 of unusually tall ⬆️ parents 🧑‍🧑‍🧒‍🧒,
tended to be shorter ⬇️ than their parents 🧑‍🧑‍🧒‍🧒, <br>
and children 👶 of unusually short ⬇️ parents 🧑‍🧑‍🧒‍🧒,
tended to be taller ⬆️ than their parents 🧑‍🧑‍🧒‍🧒.

Galton named this biological tendency - **'regression towards mediocrity/mean’**.

Galton used method of *least squares* to model this relationship, by **fitting a line** to the data 📊.

**Regression = Fitting a Line** <br>
Over time ⏳, the name **‘regression’** got **permanently attached** to the method of **fitting line** to the data 📊.

**Today** in *statistics* and **machine learning**, **‘regression’** *universally* refers to the method of finding the <br>
**‘line of best fit’** for a set of data points, NOT the concept of *‘regressing towards the mean’*.
