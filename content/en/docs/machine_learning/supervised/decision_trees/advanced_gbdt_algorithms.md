{{< panel color="orange" title="XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)" >}}
- An optimized and highly efficient implementation of gradient boosting.
- Widely used in competitive data science (like Kaggle) due to its speed and performance.
- Note: Research project developed by Tianqi Chen during his doctoral studies at the University of Washington.

{{< panel color="green" title="LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine)" >}}
- Developed by Microsoft, this framework is designed for high speed and efficiency with large datasets.
- It grows trees leaf-wise rather than level-wise and uses Gradient-based One-Side Sampling (GOSS) to speed 🐇 up the finding of optimal split points.

{{< panel color="red" title="CatBoost (Categorical Boosting)" >}}
- Developed by Yandex, this algorithm is specifically optimized for handling ‘categorical' features without requiring extensive preprocessing (such as, one-hot encoding).
