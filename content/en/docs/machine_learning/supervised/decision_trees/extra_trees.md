💡In a standard Decision Tree or Random Forest, the algorithm searches for the optimal split point (the threshold 's') 
that maximizes Information Gain or minimizes MSE.

👉This search is:
- **computationally expensive** (sort + mid-point) and
- tends to **follow the noise** in the training 🏃‍♂️data.

Adding randomness (right kind) in ensemble averaging **reduces** correlation/variance.
\[Var(f_{bag})=ρ\sigma^{2}+\frac{1-ρ}{B}\sigma^{2}\]

- **Random Thresholds**: Instead of searching for the best split point (computationally expensive 💰) for a feature, 
it picks a threshold at random from a uniform distribution between the feature's local minimum and maximum.
- **Entire Dataset**: Uses entire training dataset (default) for every tree; no bootstrapping.
- **Random Feature Subsets**: Random subset of m<n features is used in each decision tree.

\[Var(f_{et})=ρ\sigma^{2}+\frac{1-ρ}{B}\sigma^{2}\]
Picking thresholds randomly has two effects:
- Structural correlation between trees becomes extremely low.
- Individual trees are ‘weaker' and have higher bias than a standard optimized tree.

👉The massive drop in ‘\(\rho\)' often outweighs the slight increase in bias, leading to an overall ensemble that is 
smoother and more robust to noise than a standard Random Forest.

**Note**: Extra Trees are almost always grown to full depth, as they may need extra splits to find the same decision boundary.

- **Performance**: Significantly faster to train, as it does not sort data to find optimal split.
<br>**Note**: If we are working with billions of rows or thousands of features, ET can be 3x to 5x faster than a Random Forest(RF).
- **Robustness to Noise**: By picking thresholds randomly, tends to ‘handle' the noise more effectively than RF.
- **Feature Importance**: Because ET is so randomized, it often provides more ‘stable' feature importance scores. 

**Note**: It is less likely to favor a high-cardinality feature (e.g. zip-code) just because it has more potential split points.
