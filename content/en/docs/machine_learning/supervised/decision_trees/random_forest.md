{{< panel color="red" title="Problem with Bagging" >}}
💡If one feature is extremely predictive (e.g., ‘Area' for house prices), almost every bootstrap tree will split on that feature at the root.

👉This makes the trees(models) very similar, leading to a high correlation ‘\(\rho\)'.
\[Var(f_{bagging})=ρ\sigma^{2}+\frac{1-ρ}{B}\sigma^{2}\]

{{< panel color="green" title="Feature Sub Sampling" >}}
💡Choose a **random** **subset** of ‘m' features from the total ‘d' features, **reducing the correlation** ‘\(\rho\)' between trees.

👉By forcing trees to split on ‘**sub-optimal**' features, we intentionally increase the variance of individual trees;
also the bias is slightly increased (simpler trees).

**Standard heuristics**:
- Classification: \(m = \sqrt{d}\)
- Regression: \(m = \frac{d}{3}\)

{{< panel color="blue" title="Math of De-Correlation" >}}
💡Because ‘\(\rho\)' is the **dominant factor** in the variance of the ensemble when B is large, 
the overall ensemble variance Var(\(f_{rf}\)) drops significantly lower than standard Bagging.
\[Var(f_{rf})=ρ\sigma^{2}+\frac{1-ρ}{B}\sigma^{2}\]

{{< panel color="rust" title="Over-Fitting" >}}
💡A Random Forest will never overfit by adding more trees (B).

It only converges to the limit: '\(\rho\sigma^2\)'.

Overfitting is controlled by:
- depth of the individual trees.
- size of the feature subset ‘m'.

- **High Dimensionality**: 100s or 1000s of features; RF's feature sampling prevents a few features from masking others.
- **Tabular Data** (with Complex Interactions): Captures non-linear relationships without needing manual feature engineering.
- **Noisy Datasets**: The averaging process makes RF robust to outliers (especially if using min_samples_leaf).
- **Automatic Validation**: Need a quick estimate of generalization error without doing 10-fold CV (via OOB Error).
