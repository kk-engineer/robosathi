{{< panel color="orange" title="Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)" >}}
- Probabilistic model that assumes data is generated from a mixture of several Gaussian (normal) distributions with unknown parameters.
- GMM represents the probability density function of the data as a weighted sum of ‘K' component Gaussian densities.

{{< panel color="green" title="Gaussian Mixture PDF" >}}
- Overall density for a data point ‘':
- : number of component Gaussians.
- : mixing coefficient (weight) of the component, such that, and .
- : probability density function of the Gaussian component with mean and covariance matrix .
- : complete set of parameters to be estimated.
\[p(x_{i}|\mu,\Sigma)=\sum_{k=1}^{K}\pi_{k}N(x_{i}|\mu_{k},\Sigma_{k})\]

{{< panel color="blue" title="GMM Optimization (Why MLE Fails?)" >}}
- Goal 🎯 of a GMM optimization is to find the set of parameters that maximize the likelihood of observing the given data.
- 🦀 cannot be simplified.
- 🦉So, is there any other way ?
\[L(Θ|X)=\sum_{i=1}^{N}logP(x_{i}|Θ)=\sum_{i=1}^{N}log\sum_{k=1}^{K}\pi_{k}N(x_{i}|\mu_{k},\Sigma_{k})\]

- Imagine we are measuring the heights of people in a college.
- We see a distribution with two peaks (bimodal).
- We suspect there are two underlying groups:
- Group A (Men) and Group B (Women).
- Observed Variable (X): Actual height measurements.
- Latent Variable (Z): The ‘label' (Man or Woman) for each person.
- Note: We did not record this, so it is ‘hidden' or ‘latent'.

{{< panel color="red" title="Latent Variable Model" >}}
- A Latent Variable Model assumes that the observed data ‘X' is generated by first picking a latent state ‘z' and then drawing a sample from the distribution associated with that state.

{{< panel color="navy" title="GMM as Latent Variable Model" >}}
- GMM is a latent variable model, meaning each data point is assumed to have an associated unobserved (latent) variable indicating which component generated it.
- Note: We observe the data point but we do not observe which cluster it belongs to ().
{{< /panel >}}

{{< panel color="blue" title="Latent Variable Purpose" >}}
- If we knew the value of (component indicator) for every point, estimating the parameters of each Gaussian component would be straightforward.
- Note: The challenge lies in estimating both the parameters of the Gaussians and the values of the latent variables simultaneously.
{{< /panel >}}

{{< panel color="orange" title="Cluster Indicator (z) & Log Likelihood (sum)" >}}
- With ‘z' unknown: maximize 🦀 cannot be simplified.
- With ‘z' known: The log-likelihood of the ‘complete data' simplifies into a sum of logarithms: 🦉Every point is assigned to exactly one cluster, so the sum disappears because there is only one cluster responsible for that point.
- Note: This allows the logarithm to act directly on the exponential term of the Gaussian, leading to simple linear equations.
{{< /panel >}}

{{< panel color="green" title="Hard Assignment Simplifies Estimation" >}}
- When ‘z' is known, every data point is ‘labeled' with its parent component. To estimate the parameters (mean and covariance ) for a specific component ‘k' :
- Gather all data points , where = k.
- Calculate the standard Maximum Likelihood Estimate.(MLE) for that single Gaussian using only those points.
{{< /panel >}}

{{< panel color="red" title="Closed-Form Solution" >}}
- Knowing ‘z' provides exact counts and component assignments, leading to direct formulae for the parameters:
- Mean (): Arithmetic average of all points assigned to component ‘k'.
- Covariance (): Sample covariance of all points assigned to component ‘k'.
- Mixing Weight (): Fraction of total points assigned to component ‘k'.
