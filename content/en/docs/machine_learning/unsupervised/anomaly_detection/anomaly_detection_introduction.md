{{< panel color="blue" title="What is Anomaly?" >}}
- 🦄 Anomaly is a rare item, event or observation which deviates significantly from the majority of the data and does not conform to a well defined notion of normal behavior.
- Note: Such examples may arouse suspicions of being generated by a different mechanism, or appear inconsistent with the remainder of that set of data.

- 🐙 Anomaly detection (Outlier detection or Novelty detection) is the identification of unusual patterns or anomalies or outliers in a given dataset.

{{< panel color="green" title="What to do with Outliers ?" >}}
- ❌ Remove Outliers:
- Rejection or omission of outliers from the data to aid statistical analysis, for example to compute the mean or standard deviation of the dataset.
- Remove outliers for better predictions from models, such as linear regression.🔦Focus on Outliers:
- Fraud detection in banking and financial services.
- Cyber security: intrusion detection, malware, or unusual user access patterns.

{{< panel color="red" title="Anomaly Detection Methods 🐉" >}}
- Supervised
- Semi-Supervised
- Unsupervised (most common) ✅
- Note: Labeled anomaly data is often unavailable in real-world scenarios.

- Statistical Methods: Z-Score, large value means outlier, IQR, point beyond fences (Q1 - 1.5*IQR or Q3 + 1.5*IQR) is flagged as an outlier.
- Distance Based: KNN, points far from their neighbors as potential anomalies.
- Density Based: DBSCAN, points in low density regions are considered outliers.
- Clustering Based: K-Means, points far from cluster centroids that do not fit any cluster are anomalies.
