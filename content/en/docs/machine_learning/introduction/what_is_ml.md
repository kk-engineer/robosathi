**Machine Learning:** <br>
Machine Learning  =  to teach computers 💻 to learn from data, find patterns 🧮, and make decisions or predictions 
without being explicitly programmed for every task, as humans🧍‍♀️🧍 learn from experience.

{{< panel color="orange" title="Phases of Machine Learning" >}}
The machine learning lifecycle ♼ is generally divided into two main stages:
- Training Phase
- Runtime (Inference) Phase

**Training Phase:** <br>
Where the machine learning model is developed and taught to understand a specific task using a large volume 
of historical data.

**Runtime (Inference) Phase:** <br> 
Where the fully trained and deployed model is put to practical use in a real-world 🌎 environment, i.e., 
to make predictions on new, unseen data.
