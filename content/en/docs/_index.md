[This sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NUv9DrXJcFZs0SGHiLo8GSyCP58nR2_1lD1YDGzwC1A/edit?gid=0#gid=0) contains all the topics that will be covered for Maths for AI & ML.

Below is the list of topics that will be covered in this course.
-  Probability
-  Statistics
-  Linear Algebra
-  Calculus
-  Co-Ordinate Geometry (used everywhere for visualizing graphs of line, curve, plane, etc.)

{{< alert color="success" >}}We will understand each topic from pure AI & ML perspective.{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert color="warning" >}}We will NOT go into much of theoretical proof of everything. <br> However, we will dive deep as and when required.{{< /alert >}}
