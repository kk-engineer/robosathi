{{< alert color="success" >}}We will understand each mathematical topic from purely an AI & ML perspective.{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert color="warning" >}}We will NOT go into much of theoretical proof of everything. <br> 
However, we will cover everything in enough depth, <br> 
so that you can read and understand the latest AI & ML research papers.{{< /alert >}}
